    <h1>Seattle Heels Camp 2026</h1>
    <p> Seattle, Washington's first-ever heels dance convention—an immersive two-day experience created to celebrate
        femininity, strength, and confidence through movement.</p>
    <p>
        Featuring 8 workshops led by renowned heels instructors from across the country, each class offers a 90-minute
        heels choreography that dives deep into musicality, balance, control, and performance quality. Designed to be
        accessible and empowering for dancers of all levels, this convention welcomes everyone—from first-time heels
        dancers to seasoned performers.
    </p>
    <p>
        The event spans two full days, with four workshops each day, giving dancers the opportunity to train intensively
        while fully embodying the art of heels dance. Beyond choreography, Seattle Heels Camp focuses on building
        balance, activating the muscles essential for heels work, and embracing femininity with power and intention.
    </p>
    <p>
        Come train, connect, and step into your confidence—this is more than a convention, it's an empowered heels
        experience.</p>
